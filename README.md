# 📘 Course Curriculum Page

A professional-grade, dynamic course curriculum screen for an educational mobile/web application. This screen enables learners to track their **weekly and daily progress**, interact with **exclusive reels**, and unlock chapters sequentially upon completion.

---

## 📌 Features

* **Weekly Progress Tracker**
  Visual tracker showing overall course completion percentage.

* **Daily Progress Card** *(if implemented)*
  Optionally shows daily goals or habits (can be extended).

* **Locked Chapter System**
  Chapters remain locked until prior ones are completed — ensures structured progression.

* **Course Sections & Chapters**
  Supports modular content delivery (e.g. “Start Speaking: From Zero to Basic”).

* **Exclusive Reels**
  Highlight reels for supplementary engagement, e.g. videos with teachers.

* **Responsive UI/UX**

## 🧠 Logic Overview

### 📈 Progress Logic

* Weekly progress is fetched from user activity and reflected on a progress bar.
* Each chapter/module tracks its own completion state (e.g., using local state, Redux, or backend sync).

### 🔓 Chapter Unlock Flow

1. First chapter is unlocked by default.
2. When a chapter is marked as complete:

   * Its status is updated (persisted to local or backend store).
   * The next chapter in sequence becomes unlocked.
3. Locked chapters have a blurred overlay and lock icon until prerequisites are fulfilled.

### 🔒 Subscription Check (if applicable)

Some modules like `Use Easy and Powerful Words` are subscription-gated.

* If user is unsubscribed, show lock icon and “Subscribe to Unlock” text.
* On tap, redirect to subscription screen.

## 🔧 Tech Stack

* **Frontend**: Flutter 
* **State Management**: Redux / Context API / Zustand
* **UI Library**: Tailwind CSS / Styled Components / NativeBase
* **Backend (Optional)**: Firebase / Node.js / REST API
